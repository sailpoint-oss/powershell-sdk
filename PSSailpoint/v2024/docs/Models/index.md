The PowerShell SDK utilizes data models to structure and manage data within the API. These models provide essential details about the data, including its attributes, data types, and how these models relate to each other. Understanding these models is crucial for interacting with the API effectively.


## Key Features
- Attributes: Describes each attribute, including its name, data type, and whether it's required.
- Validation & Constraints: Highlights any rules or limitations for the attributes (e.g., formats or length limits).
- Example: Provides a sample of how the model is used in the API.
