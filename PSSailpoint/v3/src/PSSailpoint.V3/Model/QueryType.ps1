.SYNOPSIS

Enum QueryType.

.DESCRIPTION

The type of query to use.  By default, the `SAILPOINT` query type is used, which requires the `query` object to be defined in the request body. To use the `queryDsl` or `typeAheadQuery` objects in the request, you must set the type to `DSL` or `TYPEAHEAD` accordingly. Additional values may be added in the future without notice.

    # enum value: "TEXT"
